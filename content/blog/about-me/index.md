description: I attended the University of California, Irvine. I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2017 and completed a coding bootcamp in 2018. I currently work as a Motion Designer and Web Developer for Unfold Agency. I have a diverse set of skills, with the ability to create websites, program apps, develop AR lens filter for Instagram and Snapchat, animate text on video, create video cut-downs and edits, and edit audio. I am always willing to learn and expand on my ever growing skillset.

    During my freetime, I produce content for my personal Tiktok and Instagram. My content consists of video edits and trends twisted to fit the car and motorcycle audiences. 
    I've been utilizing these videos as practice when I want to learn a new motion graphics tool or technique. 
    As of October, I currently have about 330,000 followers on Tiktok and 35,000 followers on Instagram. 
    With the amount of exposure I've received through my social media content, I have acquired multiple sponsors and brand deals. These companies include FIXD, Shine Armor, and Insta360.
