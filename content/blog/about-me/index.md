description: I attended the University of California, Irvine. I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2017 and completed a coding bootcamp in 2018. I currently work as a Motion Designer and Web Developer for Unfold Agency. I have a diverse set of skills, with the ability to create websites, program apps, develop AR lens filter for Instagram and Snapchat, animate text on video, create video cut-downs and edits, and edit audio. I am always willing to learn and expand on my ever growing skillset.
