description: Since high school, I have been creating music mixes for various clients and events. These include Hip-Hop dance teams, weddings, debuts, and other performances. I use programs such as Mixcraft and Serato to seamlessly blend together different music tracks and produce beats to create rhythmic transitions. On top of music mixes, I am also knowledgable about DJing. These skills have helped enhance audio on video pieces that I've worked on.

<p style="text-align:center">Notable teams that I have made mixes for include Kaba Modern, Common Ground, Underground, Carson Streetdance, Cerritos High School, Tustin High School, Emanon, and URMO. Videos of these performances can be found throughout Youtube and Facebook.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Below is a link to a performance by Common Ground based on the Japanese movie, Battle Royale. I produced the mix using various songs, sampled beats, and dialogue from the movie.</p>
