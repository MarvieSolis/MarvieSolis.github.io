title: Music Mixing and Production
date: "2010"
description: Since high school, I have been creating music mixes for various clients and events. These include Hip-Hop dance teams, weddings, debuts, and other performances. I use programs such as Mixcraft and Serato to seamlessly blend together different music tracks and produce beats to create rhythmic transitions. On top of music mixes, I am also knowledgable about DJing. These skills have helped enhance audio on video pieces that I've worked on.

<p style="text-align:center">Below is a link to a performance by Common Ground based on the Japanese movie, Battle Royale. I produced the mix using various songs, sampled beats, and dialogue from the movie.</p>
